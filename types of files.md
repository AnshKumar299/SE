# solutions to the Assignment 1
***C file to machine code conversion phase***

> [!IMPORTANT]
> source file (.c file) -> preprocessed  file(.i file) -> asm file (.s file) -> object file (.o file) -> linking to get Maching code (.out file)


> -I flag is used to include any header file ( just provide the location of the folder containing the header file)
> this flag should added right from stage 1 that is with -E flag to get prepocessor working

linking is combining diff object files ( diff object files can be put together to a single machine code)

#### flags ( to get desired files)
* -E (preprocessed file)
* -S (asm file)
* -c (obj file)
> priority is top to bottom in increasing order ie using anything in the bottom will include the top


> [!IMPORTANT]
> linking occurs at conversion from .o file  code to .out file

> [!IMPORTANT]
> -g flag is used to include debuggin features like code snippet and other things (should be used with -S and onwards)

> [!WARNING]
> ignore the a.c~ file , that is a swap(backup) file generated by cli-editors (mam just forgot to delete that)
